/*
 * get_cpu_mstate() is passed an array of timestamps, NCMSTATES
 * long, and it fills in the array with the time spent on cpu in
 * each of the mstates, where time is returned in nsec.
 *
 * No guarantee is made that the returned values in times[] will
 * monotonically increase on sequential calls, although this will
 * be true in the long run. Any such guarantee must be handled by
 * the caller, if needed. This can happen if we fail to account
 * for elapsed time due to a generation counter conflict, yet we
 * did account for it on a prior call (see below).
 *
 * The complication is that the cpu in question may be updating
 * its microstate at the same time that we are reading it.
 * Because the microstate is only updated when the CPU's state
 * changes, the values in cpu_intracct[] can be indefinitely out
 * of date. To determine true current values, it is necessary to
 * compare the current time with cpu_mstate_start, and add the
 * difference to times[cpu_mstate].
 *
 * This can be a problem if those values are changing out from
 * under us. Because the code path in new_cpu_mstate() is
 * performance critical, we have not added a lock to it. Instead,
 * we have added a generation counter. Before beginning
 * modifications, the counter is set to 0. After modifications,
 * it is set to the old value plus one.
 *
 * get_cpu_mstate() will not consider the values of cpu_mstate
 * and cpu_mstate_start to be usable unless the value of
 * cpu_mstate_gen is both non-zero and unchanged, both before and
 * after reading the mstate information. Note that we must
 * protect against out-of-order loads around accesses to the
 * generation counter. Also, this is a best effort approach in
 * that we do not retry should the counter be found to have
 * changed.
 *
 * cpu_intracct[] is used to identify time spent in each CPU
 * mstate while handling interrupts. Such time should be reported
 * against system time, and so is subtracted out from its
 * corresponding cpu_acct[] time and added to
 * cpu_acct[CMS_SYSTEM].
